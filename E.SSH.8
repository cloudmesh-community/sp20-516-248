#Assume I participate in a vidoe conference call and I accidently share my public key
#What should I do?

#Your public key is safe to share.
#However you can always generate a new public key if needed.
#Your public key is stored in the file id_rsa.pub
#You can generate a new key pair with the code "ssh-keygen -t rsa -C hbooklan@iu.edu"
