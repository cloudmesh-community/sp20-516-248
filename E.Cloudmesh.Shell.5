# At this time one needs to quote in some commands the " in the
shell command line. Develop and test code that fixes this.

Currently cmd5 has a quotes in the commandline bug, there are issues with the code:
    cms hannah -f \"file name with spaces\"
To fix this bug, one must use shelx.

shlex.quotes can be used
  *shelex.quotes: includes both double and single quotes.  Considers characters as string quotes.
  
  Example Code:
  import shlex 
  s=shlex.shlex("Good Morning Hello Sun"), punctuation_chars="")
  list(s)
  
  Example Code:
  import shlex
  from shlex import quote
  s = "Good Morning Hello Sun".format(quote=" ")
  print(s)
