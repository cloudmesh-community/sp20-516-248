#E.Datacenter.1: Complete definitions of the terms used in the relevant section.
* Data Center Energy Costs: the cost of energy used to operate datacenter equipment. 
* Energy usage is measured by kilowatts used per hours, kWh
* Energy Consumption= (kWh)(number of minutes the power was consumed)
* Energy costs depend on two things: energy and demand changes
* Energy demand: In a 15 minute period it is the highest total consumption
* Virtualization reduces energy costs by highly utilizing a few servers rather than running many server
* As more serves are utilized the demand charge will level out


#E.Datacenter.2: Carbon footprints of data centers
* Datacenters consume a large amount of energy which contributes to green house gases and carbon emissions
* Datacenters consumption of energy is positively related to: data demand, high performance systems, and bandwidth
* By 2020 it is estimated that 139 billion kWh of energy will be used in that year alone
* Peaking Plants, Peakers: power plants that generate large amounts of carbon emissions, because they are powered by coal.
* Peakers, offer more expensive energy and are only used when there is high demand for energy
* Avoided Emissions: efforts to reduce carbon emissions by using energy efficient technologies and tactics to reduce underground carbon from escaping
* Carbon dioxcide, CO2: carbon has a life cycle of 100 years, datacenters and energy plants release large amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere
* Datacenter carbon profile: records and calculated the carbon released durring decommissioning, manufacturing, operation, transportation, packaging, and storage of data
* Power Usage Effectiveness, PUE: is used to determine how much energy is used for computing equipment vs. other energy costs
* A PUE of less than 50% is inefficient, a PUE of 50% is average, and a PUE of over 50% is efficient

#E.Datacenter.3: Your own carbon footprint
*Added the Equinix row to the data spreadsheet "Sheet CarbonFootPrint"


#E.Datacenter.4:Pick a renewable energy from Section 4.1.10 and describe what it is, find data centers that use that energy form, include information in hid directory in datacenter.md
* Solar: energy created from the sun's energy which is harvested by using solar panels.  Google just bilt the largest solar farms in existence in Alabama and Tennessee
* Energy Centers that use Solar Energy:Findland, Alabama, Tennessee, North Carolina, Netherlands, Iowa, Tiawan
* Google Data Center Fleet: the Dalles, Mayes County, Council Bluffs, Lenoir, Berkley County, Douglas County, Quilicura, Eernshaven, Dublin, St. Ghislain, Hamina, Singapore, Changua County, and Data Center


#E.Datacenter.5: Pick a country, state, or company from Section 4.1.11 and summarize their efforts towards renewable energy and impacts on society, add it to datacenter.md and cite internet resources
* Google:dedicated to reducing carbon emissions by matching thier entire annual electricity consumption with renewable energy, invest money in solar panels
* 5,475 megawatts of solar energy, long term inccremental solar energy purchases with a goal of transitioning all energy to renewable sources
* Google is providing more grants for renewable energy sources (REBA)

#E.Datacenter.6: write about cooling technologies in datacenter rack doors, so it will be contributed to Section 4.1.5
* Water cooled doors that are at the rack, many vendors provide cooling
* Data Center Rack Cooling with Rear Door Heat Exchanger: liquid cooling devices are being used more often then under floor air flow cooling devices.
* Liquid cooling devices in server racks, airflow from the server rack removes servers heat by using the central chiller plant's cooling water that is circulated througout the plant. 
* The cooling water is circulated through a heat exchanger plate and frame in the cooling tower.
* There are a couple of cooling options: rear door heat exchangers that have a fan, in row coolers, closed coulped coolers, and modular overhead coolers.
* An Rear Door Heat Exchangers, RDHx cooling device, can be used to cool the air flow, by exchanging heat from the air to the cold water in the cooling tower.

#E.Datacenter.7: Review the nature article, is there anymore data available?  What lessons do you take from the article?
* The nature artcle describes how the amount of data being collected is increasing exponentially.  
* Many websites and companies are collecting data like: Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and Bitcoin.
* To meet the increased data demand more data centers are being built and more energy is being used.
* There are many energy demands from the main sources: networks, ICT production, data centers, and consumer devices; all of which are exponentially increasing
* Virtual currencies like Bit coin also increase the demand for data centers and energy with all the transaction data it generates
* Open Computer Project was created to find more energy efficient solutions for data centers
* Power Usage Efficiency, PUE is used to calculate the efficiency of data centers
* PUE is calculated by total energy used divided by the total computing energy use.
* PUE can be increased by eliminating zombie severs, servers that are not used but take up power
* Autoscaling saves power by reducing the number of servers being used during low traffic hours
* Cooling towers can increase energy costs, save money in cooler climates by using outside air to cool servers or use piped water


#E.Datacenter.8: Find major data center outages, discuss impact on the internet and user community, how many users/services were impacted and which, cost revenue loss, media impact?
* Microsoft's software Microsoft Teams data outage effected 20 million users worldwide, no one was able to login, productivity costs
* The system failure was attributed to a build up of many small mistakes, one of which was the failure to updat the Secure Socket Layer, SSL certificate
* A google search revealed that data center outages can cost a company $9,000 a minute, no exact financial losses were included in the article
