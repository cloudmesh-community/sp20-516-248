#Create a SSH key pair
*There are several ways to create an SSH key pair, through OpenSSH client on Windows, Gitbash, Makefiles on Windows, Cygwin, Putty, Chocolatey, and ZSH

#To check whether there are already keys on the computer and to see what is in the .ssh directory:
    *ls ~/.ssh
    *if the computer has the files id_dsa.pub then keys are already setup on the computer    

#To generate a key:
  *ssh-keygen -t rsa -C <comment>
  *create a comment to remind you that a key has already been created

#Enter a default location/file to store a key
  *should use the default location ~/.ssh/ and the default name id_rsa
  *press enter
  
#Create a passphrase for the key

#To check whether the ssh key is in the directory
  *cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

#To change your passphrase, us the ssh-keygen command:
  *ssh-keygen -p
  
#To add a key pair to your current session, use the command ssh-add
  *ssh allwos the user to use any number of servers from many different organizations 
  *without having to retype your password everytime when connecting between servers
  *used by system administrators to login to multiple servers
  
#To us ethe SSH key across terminal shells, ass an SSH agent:
  *eval "ssh-agent"
  *eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
  
 #To add a key use:
  *ssh-add
 
 #To remove the agent:
  *kill $SSH_AGENT_PID
  
  
  
  #Ussing SSH on Mac
  *open up the terminal
