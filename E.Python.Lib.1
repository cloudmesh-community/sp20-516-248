#  Write a python program called iterate.py that accepts an integer n
from the command line. Pass this integer to a function called iterate.
The iterate function should then iterate from 1 to n. If the i-th number
is a multiple of three, print multiple of 3, if a multiple of 5 print
multiple of 5, if a multiple of both print multiple of 3 and 5, else print
the value.



*Example Code:
    n = int(input("Please enter an integer, n:"))
    if n%5*3==0:
      print('The integer n is a multiple of both 3 and 5!')
    elif n%3 == 0:
      print('The integer n is a multiple of 3!')
    elif n%5== 0:
      print('The integer n is a multiple of 5!')
    else:
      print('The integer n is not a multiple of either 3 or 5!')
   
   
   
 *Example Code:
 n = int(input("Please enter an integer, n:"))
class Iterable(object):

    def __init__(self,n):
        self.n = n
        self.location = 0

    def __iter__(self):
        return self

    def next(n):
        if self.n%3*5==0:
            print('The integer n is a multiple of both 3 and 5!')
            raise StopIteration

    def next(n):
        if self.n%3==0:
            print('The integer n is a multiple of 3 only!')
            raise StopIteration

    def next(n):
        if self.n%5==0:
            print('The integer n is a multiple of 5 only!')
            raise StopIteration

    def next(n):
        if self.n%5!=0:
            print('The integer n is not a multiple of either 3 or 5!')
            raise StopIteration
            
            
            
 *Example Code:
n = int(input("Please enter an integer, n from 1 to infinity:"))

while n<1:
    print('Please enter a number larger than 1!')
    end
while n%(5*3)==0:
    print('The integer n is a multiple of both 3 and 5!')
    end
while n%3 == 0:
    print('The integer n is a multiple of 3!')
    end
while n%5== 0:
    print('The integer n is a multiple of 5!')
    end
else:
    print('The integer n is not a multiple of either 3 or 5!')
